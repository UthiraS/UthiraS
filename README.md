# Hi there 👋 I'm Uthiralakshmi Sivaraman

Robotics Software Engineer working on embedded controls for industrial equipment. I build vision-based robotic applications and work with manipulator systems.

## My Journey
Started at HTIC Medical Robotics → MS in Robotics Engineering at WPI → Autonomous delivery robots at Void Robotics → Currently developing embedded controls for boom and aerial lifts

## What I Work On
- 🤖 Robotic manipulators (3-6 axis, 6 DOF)
- 👁️ Computer vision and perception systems
- 🚗 Autonomous navigation
- ⚙️ Embedded controls for industrial robotics

## Featured Repos
- **Tesla-like Self-Driving Visualization**: End-to-end ML pipeline with object detection and depth estimation
- **Pallet Detection System**: Custom YOLOv11 for warehouse automation
- **3D Perception Pipeline**: RGB-D descriptor comparison using PCL
- **RL Motion Planner**: Reinforcement learning for robot navigation
